NaN stands for not a number representing an undefined or unrepresentable value in computing
([NaN - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN)). 

But there is also a deeper meaning of it. In recent years companies want to put a number on us 
in order to easily categorize us for optimization of their business. If you want to make a statement 
against this activities here is the right T-Shirt for you:
